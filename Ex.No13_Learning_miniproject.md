### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060025
### AIM:
To analyze and process data from a gas sensor array to accurately detect and classify gases at low concentrations using data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
Step 2:Import necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.
Step 3:Upload or mount the gas sensor dataset from local storage or Google Drive.
Step 4:Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows.
Step 5:Check for and handle missing or duplicate data if present.
Step 6:Normalize or standardize the dataset using StandardScaler.
Step 7:Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to simplify feature space if needed.
Step 8:Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Step 9:Train a classification model such as Random Forest or SVM on the training set.
Step 10:Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Step 11:Visualize key results such as predictions, feature importance, or PCA scatter plot.

### Program:
